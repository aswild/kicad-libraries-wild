# My KiCad Symbols

This is my `Wild` KiCad symbol and footprint libraries.
Things I use will be added here and referenced by other projects.

## Setup

Just add `Wild.kicad_sym` as a symbol library called `Wild`, and the path to `Wild.pretty` as a footprint library.

You can also set the KiCad environment variable `WILD_DIR` to the path to this repository, which will configure the 3D model paths in the footprints.
